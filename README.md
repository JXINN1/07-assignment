# Normal Business Hours

*Part of an assignment for the ReCode class at NYU's IMA program, Fall 2023.*


This assignment’s purpose is really relatable to me, as I'm always trying to find a balance between online and offline life. As we are exposed to the internet 24/7/365, we often lose time to seek the real value of life in this massive, complicated digital media world.

For me personally, despite being a person who doesn’t spend that much time online on SNS and gaming, it still consists of a big portion of my life, as I almost forget everything when I scroll through endless YouTube shorts and watch TV series. It’s almost like addiction without noticing, which is really overwhelming as it feels like things are getting out of my control.

However, most importantly, I value spending time with my loved ones, including my family, girlfriend, and friends, in real-time communication and interaction, even though there is a possibility for real-time interaction to happen in the virtual world in the near future as companies like Meta are developing real-life interaction experiences in the virtual world, creating realistic virtual worlds, and trying to give the corresponding experience of interacting with a real person in real life. Even if that happens, I still value time spent with my loved ones, speaking with caring words, looking into their eyes, paying attention to their gestures, voices, and thoughts, using all my senses to fully dedicate myself to relationships, having valuable time, and making unforgettable memories, which I value over tons of fancy things that could happen online.
